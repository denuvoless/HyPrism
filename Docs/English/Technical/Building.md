# Building

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 10 SDK**
- **Node.js 20+** (includes npm)
- **Git**

## Development

### Full Build (Backend + Frontend)

```bash
dotnet build
```

This single command runs the entire MSBuild pipeline:

1. `NpmInstall` — runs `npm ci` in `Frontend/`
2. `GenerateIpcTs` — generates `Frontend/src/lib/ipc.ts` from C# annotations
3. `BuildFrontend` — runs `npm run build` (TypeScript + Vite)
4. `CopyFrontendDist` — copies `Frontend/dist/` → `bin/.../wwwroot/`
5. Standard .NET compilation

### Run

```bash
dotnet run
```

Starts the .NET Console app → spawns Electron → opens the window.

### Frontend-Only Dev

```bash
cd Frontend
npm run dev    # Vite dev server on localhost:5173
```

Useful for iterating on UI without restarting the full app. Note: IPC calls will not work in standalone mode (no Electron bridge).

### Regenerate IPC

```bash
node Scripts/generate-ipc.mjs
```

Or triggered automatically by `dotnet build` when `IpcService.cs` changes.

## Production Build

```bash
# Build frontend for production
cd Frontend && npm run build

# Publish .NET
dotnet publish -c Release
```

The published output is in `bin/Release/net10.0/linux-x64/publish/` (or platform equivalent) and includes the `wwwroot/` folder with the compiled frontend.

## Platform Notes

### Linux

```bash
# Standard build
dotnet build

# Production publish
dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64

# Flatpak (see Packaging/flatpak/)
flatpak-builder build Packaging/flatpak/dev.hyprism.HyPrism.json
```

Release CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) publishes Linux artifacts for `linux-x64` only. Linux `arm64` release builds are not supported.

### macOS

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-x64
# Or for Apple Silicon:
dotnet publish -c Release -r osx-arm64
```

See `Packaging/macos/Info.plist` for macOS-specific metadata.

At startup, HyPrism resolves `icon.png` from multiple packaged locations before calling `Electron.Dock.SetIcon()`. If the icon is missing, startup continues and the dock-icon call is skipped (no main-process crash).

Frontend favicon for packaged `file://` runs is served from `Frontend/public/icon.png` and referenced as `./icon.png` in `Frontend/index.html`.

For macOS publish (`Scripts/publish.sh`), `Build/icon.icns` is regenerated from `Frontend/public/icon.png` before building DMG artifacts.

Electron Builder icon paths are resolved relative to `directories.buildResources` (`Build/`), so icon fields should use `icon.png`, `icon.ico`, and `icon.icns` (not `Build/...`).

`Scripts/publish.sh` now writes an absolute `directories.buildResources` path to `Build/` in its generated Electron Builder config so packaged icons resolve consistently in local and CI builds.

### Windows

```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64
```

## MSBuild Targets

| Target | Trigger | Purpose |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `NpmInstall` | Before `GenerateIpcTs` | `npm ci --prefer-offline` |
| `GenerateIpcTs` | Before `BuildFrontend` | `node Scripts/generate-ipc.mjs` |
| `BuildFrontend` | Before `Build` | `npm run build` in Frontend/ |
| `CopyFrontendDist` | After `Build` | Copy dist → wwwroot |

All targets use incremental build (Inputs/Outputs) to avoid unnecessary work.
