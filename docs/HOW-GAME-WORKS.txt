HOW GAME LAUNCHING AND PATCHING WORKS

When user clicks PLAY:

1. DownloadAndLaunchAsync() in AppService.cs runs
2. Downloads game zip from Hytale servers if not installed, extracts to instances/{branch}/{version}/
3. If already installed, checks for updates and applies .pwr patch files using Butler

Patching (ClientPatcher.cs):

1. EnsureClientPatched() finds the client binary
2. PatchClient() reads the binary, searches for "hytale.com" string
3. Replaces "hytale.com" with "sanasol.ws" (same 10 char length)
4. This makes sessions.hytale.com become sessions.sanasol.ws
5. PatchServerJar() does the same for Server/HytaleServer.jar (needed for singleplayer)
6. Saves backup as .original, creates .patched_custom flag so it doesnt patch again
7. On macOS re-signs with codesign after patching

Launching (LaunchGameAsync in AppService.cs):

1. Gets UUID for username (same username = same UUID always)
2. If online mode: calls AuthService to get identity + session tokens from auth server
3. Starts HytaleClient with args:
   --app-dir, --user-dir, --java-exec, --name, --auth-mode, --uuid, --identity-token, --session-token

Thats it.
