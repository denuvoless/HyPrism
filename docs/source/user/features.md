# Features (User-facing)

HyPrism is a launcher and utility suite with the following user-facing features:

- **Profiles**: create, duplicate, delete, and switch profiles with separate configuration sets.
- **Onboarding**: first-run experience to help you configure the app.
- **Mod/Installation management (Butler/Mod Manager)**: download and patch game files, track progress and updates.
- **Client Patcher**: safely patch the game client binaries to use custom domains or disable telemetry.
- **Discord integration & announcements**: show announcements pulled from a configured Discord channel; optional Discord presence via RPC.
- **Auto-updates & packaging**: optional update mechanisms and Flatpak packaging for Linux releases.

## Quick Walkthrough

- Open the app and create a profile from the `Profiles` menu.
- Use `Mod Manager` to add or update mods and run the patcher to apply changes to the client.
- Check `Settings` to enable/disable Discord announcements, telemetry, or RPC.
